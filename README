### Golang CLI Projects: Small Challenges, Big Learning

Diving into Golang with a collection of small CLI projects. Each challenge is a chance to sharpen my skills and explore new ideas.

Ask about the food, movement, and sounds of cows, birds, and snakes. It’s a fun way to see how I handle data and methods in Golang!

Got numbers? Add up to 10, and watch my Go program sort them for you using bubble sort! It’s a hands-on way to see sorting in action and explore how I tackle algorithm challenges.
